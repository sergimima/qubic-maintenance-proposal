# Proposal Continuation Agreement for Qubic Bridge Operation

## Proposal

Vottun proposes a 12-month continuation agreement with the Qubic Incubation Program to operate and maintain the Qubic Bridge—a next-generation, non-custodial cross-chain bridge connecting Qubic and Ethereum. Vottun will ensure secure, reliable operations of validator services, APIs, and middleware while supporting Qubic's broader ecosystem growth.

The agreement includes:

- **Annual Maintenance Fee**: 30,000 USDT (payable in USDT, USDC, or QUBIC with 5% adjustment if in QUBIC) to cover updates, monitoring, and security during the first 12 months.
- **Liquidity Provision**: Request for the Incubation Program or its market maker to seed an initial wQubic/ETH pool on Uniswap by bridging ~$25,000 in QUBIC paired with ETH. This liquidity will remain under Incubation/MM ownership, allowing them to capture fees and withdraw at any time.

This combination of stable funding and initial liquidity ensures that QBridge launches successfully, becomes self-sustaining through transaction fees, and attracts additional community participation. The proposal also establishes clear SLA commitments and a structured review process to adapt to Qubic's evolution while minimizing risk.

**In short**: this is a low-risk, high-impact initiative to accelerate interoperability, drive adoption, and strengthen Qubic's position in the DeFi ecosystem.

## Available Options

- **Option 0**: No, don't allow
- **Option 1**: Yes, allow

## What is QBridge, and what is needed to launch it

QBridge is a next-generation, non-custodial cross-chain bridge that links the Qubic blockchain directly with the Ethereum network. Taking cues from the seamless user experience of top bridging protocols, QBridge is engineered to let anyone transfer Qubic tokens between Qubic and ETH in seconds without sacrificing security or decentralization. Our goal is simple: unlock friction-free interoperability so builders and users can tap the liquidity, dApp ecosystems, and developer tools of both chains from a single entry point.

This bridge strengthens Qubic's ecosystem by making wQubic more accessible, driving trading activity, and signaling leadership to the broader DeFi community.

The proposal agreement includes clear SLA commitments, transparent review mechanisms, and a framework for handling liquidity, future upgrades, ensuring long-term sustainability and ecosystem growth.

# Contract Proposal for Qubic Incubation
## Continuation Agreement for Qubic Bridge Operation

This Agreement is made between Vottun ("Operator") and the Qubic Incubation Program ("Client") to define the terms under which Vottun will continue to operate and maintain the Qubic Bridge for the next 12 months.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this agreement is to ensure the secure and reliable operation of the Qubic Bridge by Vottun, as well as the continued enhancement and support of the underlying software and infrastructure.

## 2. Bridge Operation

Vottun shall be responsible for running, monitoring, and maintaining the bridge infrastructure, including validator services, APIs, and middleware. This is done on behalf of the shareholder that owns Qubic Smart Contract after CCF is processed.

As general compensation for operating the bridge, based on the to be approved IPO, Vottun shall receive 50% of all fees generated by the bridge transactions. The remaining 50% of all fees generated by the bridge will go to the winner of the smart contract CFF bidding. Part of the bridge fees (40%) are suggested to be locked in the LP created in Uniswap to provide liquidity for the bridge.

## 3. Annual Maintenance Agreement Fee

In addition to the transaction-based fee share, Vottun request to establish an initial annual service agreement fee paid by the Qubic Incubation Program to assure technical maintenance, updates, security patches, and feature improvements over the first 12 months as it is not expected that the initial fees will be able to support all the initial efforts of maintaining the bridge as Qubic technology change and matures.

**Annual Fee**: Equivalent of 30,000 USDT, payable in $USDT, $USDC, or QUBIC tokens. If payment is made in QUBIC, an additional 5% shall be added to the total amount due to volatility adjustment.

## 4. Provide Initial Liquidity for QBridge

In order to provide the initial liquidity for the bridge, we need assistance from the Incubation Program or the Market Maker (MM) used by Qubic.

It is necessary to create an initial liquidity pool for wQubic/ETH, and we suggest deploying this pool on Uniswap. To achieve this, we propose that the Incubation Program or Qubic's MM bridge $25,000 worth of Qubic and pair it with an equivalent amount of ETH in Uniswap. These funds would remain under the ownership and management of the Incubation Program or MM, allowing them to capture fees from bridge transactions and retain full flexibility to withdraw the funds at any time.

By seeding this initial liquidity, the Incubation Program or Qubic's MM not only ensures the bridge launches successfully but also positions itself to directly capture ongoing transaction fees. This initiative strengthens Qubic's ecosystem by making wQubic more accessible, increasing trading activity, and showcasing the project's growth potential to the broader DeFi community.

This early support signals leadership and commitment, which will encourage the wider Qubic community to follow suit, rapidly expanding the liquidity pool and amplifying network effects.

**In short**, this is a low-risk, high-visibility opportunity to accelerate adoption while generating sustainable fee revenue.

We expect that once this pool is created, more members of the Qubic community will join to provide additional liquidity and earn yield from AMM fees, further reinforcing the bridge's strength and stability.

## 5. Future Upgrades Beyond Maintenance Scope

Vottun shall not be obligated to implement or adapt to any future upgrades, architectural changes, or breaking updates made to the Qubic protocol, SDKs, consensus mechanism, or core infrastructure that fall outside the scope of standard maintenance, unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties. In such cases, any work required from Vottun to adapt the bridge infrastructure to such upgrades shall be subject to a separate scoping discussion, timeline, and commercial agreement, independent of the standard annual maintenance fee.

## 6. Service Level Agreement Proposed

Vottun will provide business-hours support for the Qubic Bridge from Monday to Friday, 09:00 – 18:00 CET (UTC +1), excluding Spanish national holidays. During these hours Vottun will continuously monitor the bridge and meet the following targets:

| Severity | Definition | Initial Response | Workaround Target | Full Resolution Target |
|----------|------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **S1 — Critical** | Bridge fully down, funds at risk, or security incident | ≤ 30 min | ≤ 4 business hours | ≤ 24 hours |
| **S2 — High** | Degraded performance or partial outage with no immediate fund risk | ≤ 2 business hours | ≤ 1 business day | ≤ 3 business days |
| **S3 — Normal** | Minor issue, cosmetic defect, or non-blocking request | ≤ 1 business day | N/A | Next scheduled maintenance release |

### Additional SLA Details:

- If an S1-level incident occurs outside business hours, our on-call engineers will automatically be contacted, and we will strive to meet the same S1 response and resolution timelines.
- Scheduled maintenance will be announced ≥ 24 hours in advance and, when feasible, performed outside business hours.
- Vottun targets ≥ 99.5% monthly uptime for core bridge functions, excluding announced maintenance windows.

## 7. Term and Review

This Agreement shall remain in force for an initial period of twelve (12) months from the Effective Date (the "Initial Term"). No later than thirty (30) days before the end of the Initial Term, the Parties will jointly review the total fees generated by the Bridge and compare them with the annual Maintenance Fee.

- If the Bridge fees allocated to Vottun (50% share) exceed by 30% the Maintenance Fee for the same period, the Parties acknowledge that the Bridge is self-sustaining; in that event, this Agreement will expire at the end of the Initial Term unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to renew or modify it.
- If the Bridge fees are below the Maintenance Fee, the Parties may renew this Agreement for a further twelve-month term, with any scope adjustments to be agreed in writing during the review.

All other renewal decisions will be based on this annual fee-review process.

## 8. Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement with 60 days' written notice. In case of breach of contract, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement with 15 days' notice if the breach is not remedied.

## 9. Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising from or related to this agreement shall first be resolved through good-faith negotiations between the parties. If a resolution is not reached within 30 days, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce), with the seat of arbitration in Barcelona, Spain. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.

## 10. Jurisdiction and Smart Contract Enforcement

This agreement and any smart contract components related to fee distribution, staking, or bridging mechanisms shall be governed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Any legal enforcement concerning smart contract governance will also be interpreted within this jurisdiction.
